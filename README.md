# Predict-Electricity-Price-And-Load-
Predicting electricity bill and usage by using Timeseries Analysis 
The goal is to analyze electricity data:
1. Use visualization techniques to find statistical patterns inside the data set.
2. Do bivariate analysis over different features and see if any correlation exists
between different features.
3. Design a statistical model to predict the electricity price of a given day if all of the
other features are given.
4. Design a statistical model to predict the electricity Load of a given day if all of the
other features are given
